# v1.0.3
Themed more missed areas.

# v1.0.2
A few additions:
- Themed some missing things.
- Added custom HLJS styling for codeblocks as an addon.

# v1.0.1
Some small general changes:
- Themed multiple areas that I missed.
- Some changes to fix USRBG from stretching to all of the user popout & user modal. I also removed the imports from BD and Web as BDFDB already imports it on BD, and Web will never have support for it period. This closes [issue #2](https://github.com/LuckFire/midnight-mars/issues/2).

# v1.0.0
Inital release, hope you enjoy!
- Pleaes note that as this is the first release, there will most likely be issues with the theme. If you notice anything wrong with it, please make an issue describing what's wrong.
